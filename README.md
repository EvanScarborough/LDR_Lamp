# LDR_Lamp

Code used to run a pair of lamps I made for my girlfriend and myself to stay connected when we are apart. The physical "lamps" are composed from strings of NeoPixel LEDs. When one lamp is updated, the other changes as well.

The lamps include a dial (rotary encoder) for changing the colors, a button for changing between a few modes, and another button for sending the colors to the other lamp. Complete build instructions will be coming soon :D
